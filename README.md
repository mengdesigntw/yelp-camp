A class project where I use nodejs to setup an express server and connect with MongoDB using mongoose.

Some functionalities are implemented as follow:

- full CRUD on campgrounds
- interactive maps from Mapbox (include clusters map)
- star-rating components
- add and remove reviews
- user authentication using passport js
- authorization
- form validation using Joi and boostrap
- image upload using Cloudinary
